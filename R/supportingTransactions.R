#' Supporting Transactions
#'
#' Find transactions which support each of a set of associations and return
#' this information as a transaction ID list.
#'
#' The supporting transactions are all transactions of which the itemset
#' representing the association is a subset of.
#'
#' @family itemMatrix and transactions functions
#' 
#' @param x a set of [associations] ([itemsets], [rules], etc.)
#' @param transactions an object of class [transactions] used to mine the
#' associations in `x`.
#' @param ... currently unused.
#' 
#' @return An object of class [tidLists] containing one transaction ID
#' list per association in `x`.
