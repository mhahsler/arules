setGeneric("sort")

#' Sort Associations
#'
#' Provides the method `sort` to sort elements in class
#' [associations] (e.g., itemsets or rules) according to the
#' value of measures stored in the association's slot `quality` (e.g.,
#' support).
#'
#' `sort` is relatively slow for large sets of associations since it has
#' to copy and rearrange a large data structure.
#' With `order = TRUE` an integer vector with the
#' order is returned instead of the reordered associations.
#'
#' If only the top `n` associations are needed then [head()] using
#' `by` performs this faster than calling `sort()` and then [`head()`]
#' since it does it without copying and rearranging all the data.  [`tail()`]
#' works in the same way.
#'
#' @include associations.R
#' @name sort
#' @aliases sort SORT
#' @family associations functions
#'
#' @param x an object to be sorted.
#' @param decreasing a logical. Should the sort be increasing or decreasing?
#' (default is decreasing)
#' @param na.last na.last is not supported for associations.  NAs are always
#' put last.
#' @param by a character string specifying the quality measure stored in
#' `x` to be used to sort `x`. If a vector of character strings is
#' specified then the additional strings are used to sort `x` in case of
#' ties.
#' @param order should a order vector (a permutation like [order()])
#'  be returned instead of the sorted associations?
#' @param ... Further arguments are ignored.
#'
#' @return An object of the same class as `x` or a permutation vector.
