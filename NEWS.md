# arules 1.6-8.1 (xx/xx/2021)

## New Feature
* constructor transactions() con now also create transactions from data in long format (tid, item).
* toLongFormat converts transactions into a long format data.frame.
* rules and itemsets have now a constructor.
* interestMeasure for rules has now measure "table" which returns the contingency table. 
* new interest measure "riskRatio" was added. 
* interestMeasure for contingency table-based measures now accept the additional parameter smoothCounts 
  which is added to each count to avoid counts of zero (Laplace smoothing). 
* new method for stats confint to calculate confidence intervals for some interest measures added.
* is_redundant can now also use confidence intervals do determine statistical redundancy.
* apriori and eclat gain ... additional arguments are now added to the parameter list.
* added new function is.generators to find itemset generators.

## Changes
* we use now a better check for installed suggested packages.
* Removed option "chiSquared" from crossTable.
* inspect uses now a space after the comma.
* interestMeasures: reuse = TRUE now only reuses the basic measures of "support", "confidence", "coverage" and
  "lift". All other measures are recalculated to account for possible differences in additional parameters.
* apriori and eclat now store the call in the info slot of the created associations.
* set methods are now also exported as S3 methods using package generics so they do not conflict with tidyverse (dplyr). 

## Bug Fixes

* frequent itemsets now do not report "transIdenticalToItemsets" (reported by galadrielbriere).

  (reported by B. Ripley)

# arules 1.2-0 (09/14/2015)

## Major Changes

* added support for weighted association rule mining (by C. Buchta):
    - transactions can store weights a column called "weight" in 
        transactionInfo.
    - support, itemFrequency and itemFrequencyPlot gained a parameter
        called weighted.
    - weclat extends eclat with transaction weights.
    - hits can be used to calculate weights from transact ions.

  with the correct number of rows for quality, itemInfo, 
  transactionInfo and itemsetInfo. These data.frames possibly have 
  0 columns.
* arules uses now testthat (tests are in tests/testthat).

## New Features

* sort can now sort by several columns (used to break ties) in quality. 
  It also gained an order parameter to return a permutation vector
  (order) instead.
* inspect gained parameters setStart, setEnd, itemSep, ruleSep and
  linebreak to control output better.
* read.transactions now ignores empty items (e.g., caused by trailing 
  commas and leading or trailing white spaces).
* labels now returns not a list but consistent labels for objects       
  (transactions, itemMatrix, rules, itemsets, and tidLists). 
* tidLists has now an inspect method, gained coercion from "list", and
  has now a replacement method for dimnames(). 
* Coercion from itemMatrix to matrix results now in a logical matrix.
* fixed as(transactions, "data.frame"). The column names do now have
  no prefix (except if transactionInfo contains an item called "items").
* transactions has now its own dimnames function which correctly returns 
  transactionID from transactionInfo as rownames.
* replacement method for dimnames() checks now dimensions.
* item labels are now internally handled as character using 
  stringAsFactor = FALSE in data.frames and not AsIs with I(character).
* rules can now have no item in the RHS.
