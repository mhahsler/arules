# arules --- Mining Association Rules and Frequent Itemsets with R

[![CRAN version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/arules)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=arules)
[![CRAN RStudio mirror downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/arules)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=arules)
[![R build status](https://github.com/mhahsler/arules/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mhahsler/arules/actions)

The arules package for R provides the infrastructure for representing,
manipulating and analyzing transaction data and patterns
using [frequent itemsets and association rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning).
The package also provides a wide range of 
[interest measures](https://mhahsler.github.io/arules/docs/measures) and mining algorithms including a interfaces and the code of
Christian Borgelt's popular and efficient C implementations of the association mining algorithms [Apriori](https://borgelt.net/apriori.html) and [Eclat](https://borgelt.net/eclat.html).
Examples can be found in [Chapter 5 of the web book R Companion for Introduction to Data Mining](https://mhahsler.github.io/Introduction_to_Data_Mining_R_Examples/book/association-analysis-basic-concepts-and-algorithms.html).

## Installation

__Stable CRAN version:__ install from within R with
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("arules")
```
__Current development version:__ install from GitHub (needs devtools and 
[Rtools for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)). 
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mhahsler/arules")
``` 

## Usage

```{r echo=FALSE}
options(digits = 2)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = TRUE, message = FALSE)
```

Load package and mine some association rules. 
```{r }
library("arules")
data("IncomeESL")

trans <- transactions(IncomeESL)
trans

rules <- apriori(trans, parameter = list(supp = 0.1, conf = 0.9, target = "rules"))
```

Inspect the rules with the highest lift.
```{r }
inspect(head(rules, n = 3, by = "lift"))
```

## Using arule and tidyverse

arules works seamlessly with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). For example, dplyr can be used for cleaning and preparing the transactions and then functions in arules can be used with `%>%`.

```{r }
library("tidyverse")
library("arules")
data("IncomeESL")

trans <- IncomeESL %>% transactions()

rules <- trans %>% apriori(parameter = list(supp = 0.1, conf = 0.9, target = "rules"))
rules %>% head(n = 3, by = "lift") %>% inspect()
```
