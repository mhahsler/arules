	would enable us to find all rules with a given minimum confidence,

	of all rules which can be produced from an itemset, i.e., all rules
	produced form an itemset will have a confidence greater or equal
	to its all-confidence value. BOND, the last measure, is defined as
	the ratio of the number of transactions which contain all items of
	an itemset to the number of transactions which contain at least one
	of these items. Omiecinski showed that bond and all-confidence are
	downward closed and, therefore, can be used for efficient mining
