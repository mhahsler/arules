# Definitions

@arules:Agrawal:1993
define [association rule mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning) in the following way: 

Let $I=\{i_1, i_2,\ldots,i_m\}$ be a set of $m$ binary attributes called
**items.**  Let $D = \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n\}$ be a set of
transactions called the **database**.  Each transaction $t \in D$ 
has a unique transaction ID and
contains a subset of the items in $I$, i. e., $t \subseteq I$.
A **rule** is defined as an implication of the form $X \Rightarrow Y$
where $X, Y \subseteq I$ and $X \cap Y = \emptyset$.  The sets of items
(for short **itemsets**) $X$ and $Y$ are called antecedent
(left-hand side or LHS) and consequent (right-hand side or RHS)
of the rule, respectively. Measures of importance (interest) can be defined
for itemsets and rules. The support-confidence framework defines the measures [support](#support) and 
[confidence](#confidence). Rules that satisfy a user-specified minimum thresholds on support and confidence
are called **association rules.**

Interest measures are usually defined in terms of itemset [support](#support), here we also
present them using probabilities and, where appropriate, counts.
The probability $P(E_X)$ of
the event that all items in itemset $X$ 
are contained in an arbitrarily chosen
transaction can be estimated from a database $D$ 
using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) by

$$\hat{P}(E_X) = \frac{|\{t \in D; X \subseteq t\}|}{n}$$

where $n_X = |\{t \in D; X \subseteq t\}|$ 
is the count of the number of transactions that
contain the itemset $X$ and $n = |D|$ is the size
(number of transactions) of the database.
For conciseness of notation, we will drop the hat and the $E$ from
the notation for probabilities. 
We will use in the following $P(X)$ to mean $\hat{P}(E_X)$ 
and $P(X \cap Y)$ to mean 
$\hat{P}(E_X \cap E_Y) = \hat{P}(E_{X \cup Y})$,
the probability of the intersection of the events $E_X$ and $E_Y$
representing the probability of the event that a transaction contains 
all items in the union of the itemsets $X$ and $Y$.
The event notation should not be confused with the set notation used in 
measures like support, where 
$supp(X \cup Y)$ means the support of the union of the itemsets $X$ and $Y$.

**Note on probability estimation:** 
The used probability estimates
will be very poor for itemsets with low observed frequencies.
This needs to be always taken into account since it 
affects most measured discussed below.

**Note on null-transactions:** 
Transaction datasets typically contain a 
large number of transactions that do not contain either $X$ or $Y$. 
These transactions are called null-transactions, and it is desirable that
measures of rule strength are not influenced by a change in the 
number of null-transactions. However, most measures are affected by the 
number of null-transactions since the total number of transactions is 
used for probability estimation. Measures that are not 
influenced by a change in the number of null-transactions are 
called null-invariant

# Measures Defined on Itemsets

## Support {#support}
**Reference:** @arules:Agrawal:1993

$$
supp(X) 
= \frac{n_X}{n}
= P(X)
$$

Support is defined on itemsets and gives the proportion of
transactions that contain $X$. It is used as a measure
of significance (importance) of an itemset. Since it
uses the count of transactions, it is often called a
**frequency constraint.** An itemset with support greater than a
set minimum support threshold, $supp(X) > \sigma$, 
is called a **frequent or large
itemset.**

For rules the support defined as the support
of all items in the rule, i.e., $supp(X \Rightarrow Y) = supp(X \cup Y) = P(X \cap Y)$.

Support's main feature is that it possesses the **downward
closure property (anti-monotonicity),** which means that all
subsets of a frequent set are also frequent. 
This property (actually, the
fact that no superset of an infrequent set can be frequent)
is used to prune the search space (usually thought of as a
lattice or tree of itemsets with increasing size) in
level-wise algorithms (e.g., the Apriori algorithm).

The disadvantage of support is the **rare item problem.**
Items that occur very infrequently in the data set are pruned,
although they would still produce interesting and potentially
valuable rules. The rare item problem is important for
transaction data which usually have a very uneven
distribution of support for the individual items (typical 
is a power-law distribution where few items
are used all the time and most items are rarely used).

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

## Support Count {#count}
**Alias:** Absolute Support Count

**Range:** $[0, n]$ where $n$ is the number of transactions.

## All-Confidence {#allconfidence}
**Reference:** @arules:Omiecinski:2003

All-confidence is defined on itemsets (not rules) as

$$\textrm{all-confidence}(X) 
= \frac{supp(X)}{max_{x \in X}(supp(x))}
= \frac{P(X)}{max_{x \in X}(P(x))}
= min\{P(X|Y), P(Y|X)\}$$

where $max_{x \in X}(supp(x \in X))$ is the support of the
item with the highest support in $X$. All-confidence
means that all rules which can be generated from itemset
$X$ have at least a confidence of
$\textrm{all-confidence}(X)$. All-confidence possesses the
downward-closed closure property and thus can be effectively used 
inside mining algorithms. All-confidence is null-invariant.

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

## Cross-Support Ratio {#crosssupportratio}
**Reference:** @arules:Xiong:2003

Defined on itemsets as the ratio of the support of the least frequent item
to the support of the most frequent item, i.e.,

$$\textrm{cross-support}(X) = \frac{min_{x \in X}(supp(x))}{max_{x \in X}(supp(x))}$$

a ratio smaller than a set threshold. Normally many found patterns are
cross-support patterns which contain frequent as well as rare items. Such
patterns often tend to be spurious.

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

# Measures Defined on Rules

## Contingency Table {#table} 

A $2 \times 2$ [contingency table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table) with counts for rule $X \Rightarrow Y$ in
the transaction dataset. The counts are:

|                |   $Y$               |  $\overline{Y}$                |
| :------------: | :-----------------: | :---------------------------:  |
| $X$            | $n_{XY}$            | $n_{X\overline{Y}}$            | 
| $\overline{X}$ | $n_{\overline{X}Y}$ | $n_{\overline{X}\overline{Y}}$ |

$n_{XY}$ is the number of transactions that contain all items in $X$ and $Y$.
All other measures for rules can be calculated using these counts.

## Confidence {#confidence}
**Alias:** Strength

**Reference:** @arules:Agrawal:1993

$$conf(X \Rightarrow Y) = \frac{supp(X \Rightarrow Y)}{supp(X)} = 
\frac{supp(X \cup Y)}{supp(X)} =
\frac{n_{XY}}{n_X} =
\frac{P(X \cap Y)}{P(X)} = P(Y | X)$$

Confidence is defined as the 
proportion of transactions that contain 
$Y$ in the set of transactions that contain $X$. This proportion
is an estimate for the 
probability of seeing the rule's
consequent under the condition that the transactions also
contain the antecedent. 

Confidence is directed and gives
different values for the rules $X \Rightarrow Y$ and $Y
\Rightarrow X$.
Association rules have to satisfy a minimum confidence constraint,
$conf(X \Rightarrow Y) \ge \gamma$.

Confidence is not downward closed and was developed together
with support by Agrawal et al. (the so-called
support-confidence framework). Support is first used to find
frequent (significant) itemsets exploiting its downward
closure property to prune the search space. Then confidence
is used in a second step to produce rules from the frequent
itemsets that exceed a min. confidence threshold.

A problem with confidence is that it is sensitive to the
frequency of the consequent $Y$ in the database.
Caused by the way confidence is calculated, consequents with
higher support will automatically produce higher confidence
values even if there exists no association between the items.

**Range:** $[0, 1]$


## Added Value {#addedvalue}
**Alias:** AV, Pavillon Index, Centered Confidence

**Reference:** @arules:Tan:2004

Quantifies how much the probability of $Y$ increases when conditioning on the transactions that contain $X$ 
Defined as 

$$AV(X \Rightarrow Y)) = conf(X \Rightarrow Y) - supp(Y) = P(Y | X) - P(Y)$$

**Range:** $[-.5, 1]$

## Casual Confidence {#casualconfidence}
**Reference:** @arules:Kodratoff:2001

Confidence reinforced by negatives given by

$$\textrm{casual-conf} = 
\frac{1}{2} [conf(X \Rightarrow Y) + conf(\overline{X} \Rightarrow \overline{Y})] =
\frac{1}{2} [P(Y|X) + P(\overline{Y}|\overline{X})]$$

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

## Casual Support {#casualsupport}
**Reference:** @arules:Kodratoff:2001

Support improved by negatives given by 

$$\textrm{casual-supp} = 
supp(X \cup Y) + supp(\overline{X} \cup \overline{Y}) =
P(X \cap Y) + P(\overline{X} \cap \overline{Y})$$

**Range:** $[0, 2]$

## Centered Confidence {#centeredconfidence}
**Alias:** relative accuracy, gain

**Reference**: @arules:Nada:1999

$$CC(X \Rightarrow Y) = conf(X \Rightarrow Y) - supp(Y)$$

**Range:** $[-1, 1 - 1/n]$

## Certainty Factor {#certainty}
**Alias:** CF, Loevinger

**Reference:** @arules:Galiano:2002

The certainty factor is a measure of the variation of the probability that
$Y$ is in a transaction when only considering transactions with $X$. 
An increasing CF
means a decrease in the probability that $Y$ is not in a transaction that 
$X$ is in. Negative CFs have a similar interpretation.

$$CF(X \Rightarrow Y) = \frac{conf(X \Rightarrow Y)-supp(Y)}{supp(\overline{Y})}
= \frac{P(Y|X)-P(Y)}{1-P(Y)}$$

**Range:** $[-1, 1]$ (0 indicates independence)

## Chi-Squared {#chisquared}
**Reference:** @arules:Brin:1997b

For the analysis of
$2 \times 2$ contingency tables,
the [chi-squared test statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) is a measure of the relationship 
between 
two binary variables ($X$ and $Y$). 
The chi-squared test statistic is used as a test for independence 
between $X$ and $Y$. The chi-squared test statistic is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\textrm{chi-squared}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
& = \sum_i \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \\
& = \frac{\left( n_{XY} - \frac{n_X n_Y}{n} \right)^2}{\frac{n_X n_Y}{n}}
+ \frac{\left( n_{\overline{X}Y} - \frac{n_{\overline{X}} n_Y}{n} \right)^2}{\frac{n_{\overline{X}} n_Y}{n}}
+ \frac{\left( n_{X\overline{Y}} - \frac{n_X n_{\overline{Y}}}{n} \right)^2}{\frac{n_X n_{\overline{Y}}}{n}}
+ \frac{\left( n_{\overline{X}\overline{Y}} - \frac{n_{\overline{X}} n_{\overline{Y}}}{n} \right)^2}{\frac{n_{\overline{X}} n_{\overline{Y}}}{n}} \\
& = n \frac{P(X \cap Y)P(\overline{X} \cap \overline{Y})  - P(X \cap \overline{Y})P(\overline{X} \cap Y)}{\sqrt{P(X)P(Y)P(\overline{X})P(\overline{Y})}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$O_i$ is the observed count of contingency table cell $i$ and $E_i$ 
is the expected count given the marginals.  
The statistic has approximately a $\chi^2$ distribution with 1 degree of
freedom (for a 2x2 contingency table). The 
critical value for $\alpha=0.05$
is $3.84$; higher chi-squared
values indicate that the null-hypothesis of independence between LHS 
and the RHS should be rejected (i.e., the rule is not spurious). 
Larger chi-squared values indicate stronger evidence that the rule
represents a strong relationship.
The statistic can be converted into a p-value using the $\chi^2$
distribution.

**Notes:** The contingency tables for some rules may 
contain cells with low expected values (less then 5) and thus
[Fisher's exact test](#fishers-exact-test) 
might be more appropriate.
Each rule represents a statistical test, and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem"> correction for multiple comparisons</a> may be necessary.
  
**Range:** $[0, \infty]$

## Collective Strength {#collectivestrength}
**Reference:** @arules:Aggarwal:1998

$$S(X) = \frac{1-v(X)}{1-E[v(X)]} \frac{E[v(X)]}{v(X)}
= 
\frac{P(X \cap Y)+P(\overline{Y}|\overline{X})}
{P(X)P(Y)+P(\overline{X})P(\overline{Y})}
$$

where $v(X)$ is the violation rate and $E[v(X)]$ is the
expected violation rate for independent items. The violation rate is
defined as the fraction of transactions that contain some of
the items in an itemset but not all. Collective strength
gives 0 for perfectly negative correlated items, infinity for
perfectly positive correlated items, and 1 if the items
co-occur as expected under independence.

Problematic is that for items with medium to low
probabilities, the observations of the expected values of the
violation rate is dominated by the proportion of transactions
that do not contain any of the items in $X$. For such
itemsets, collective strength produces values close to one,
even if the itemset appears several times more often than
expected together.

**Range:** $[0, \infty]$

## Confidence Boost {#boost}
**Reference:** @arules:Balcazar:2013

Confidence boost is the ratio of the confidence of a rule to the confidence of any more general rule (i.e., a rule with the same consequent but one or more items removed in the LHS).

$$\textrm{confidence-boost}(X \Rightarrow Y) =  
\frac{conf(X \Rightarrow Y)}{max_{X' \subset X}(conf(X' \Rightarrow Y))} =
\frac{conf(X \Rightarrow Y)}{conf(X \Rightarrow Y) - improvement(X \Rightarrow Y)} $$

Values larger than 1 mean the new rule boosts the confidence compared to the best, more general rule. The measure is related to the [improvement measure](#improvement).

**Range:** $[0, \infty]$ ($>1$ indicates a rule with confidence boost)

## Conviction {#conviction}
**Reference:** @arules:Brin:1997

$$\mathrm{conviction}(X \Rightarrow Y) =\frac{1-supp(Y)}{1-conf(X \Rightarrow Y)} 
= \frac{P(X)P(\overline{Y})}{P(X \cap \overline{Y})}$$

where $\overline{Y} = E_{\neg Y}$ is the event 
that $Y$ does not appear in a transaction.
Conviction was developed as an alternative to confidence
which was found to not capture the direction of associations
adequately. Conviction compares the probability that $X$
appears without $Y$ if they were dependent on the
actual frequency of the appearance of $X$ without
$Y$. In that respect, it is similar to lift (see the section
about lift on this page). However, in contrast to lift, it is
a directed measure since it also uses the information of the
absence of the consequent. An interesting fact is that
conviction is monotone in confidence and lift.

**Range:** $[0, \infty]$ (1 indicates independence; rules that always hold have $\infty$)

## Cosine {#cosine}
**Reference:** @arules:Tan:2004

Cosine is a null-invariant measure of correlation between the items 
in $X$ and $Y$
defined as

$$\mathrm{cosine}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= \frac{supp(X \cup Y)}{\sqrt{(supp(X)supp(Y))}} 
= \frac{P(X \cap Y)}{\sqrt{P(X)P(Y)}}
= \sqrt{P(X | Y) P(Y | X)}$$

**Range:** $[0, 1]$ ($0.5$ means no correlation)

## Coverage {#coverage}
**Alias:** LHS Support

It measures the probability that a rule $X \Rightarrow Y$ applies
to a randomly selected transaction. It is estimated by the 
proportion of transactions that contain
the antecedent of the
rule $X \Rightarrow Y$.
Therefore, coverage is sometimes called antecedent support or LHS support. 

$$\mathrm{cover}(X \Rightarrow Y) = supp(X) = P(X)$$

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

## Descriptive Confirmed Confidence {#confirmedconfidence}
**Reference:** @arules:Tan:2004

Confidence confirmed by the confidence of the negative rule.

$$\textrm{confirmed-conf} = conf(X \Rightarrow Y) - conf(X \Rightarrow \overline{Y}) 
= P(Y|X) - P(\overline{Y}|X)$$

**Range:** $[-1, 1]$

## Difference of Confidence {#doc}
**Alias:** DOC, Difference of Proportions

**Reference:** @arules:Hofmann:2001

The difference of confidence is 
the difference of the proportion of transactions containing
$Y$ in the two groups of transactions that do and do not 
contain $X$. For the analysis of 
$2 \times 2$ contingency tables, 
this measure of the relationship between two binary variables 
is typically 
called the difference of proportion. 
It is defined as
$$
\mathrm{doc}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= conf(X \Rightarrow Y) - conf(\overline{X} \Rightarrow Y) 
= P(Y|X) - P(Y|\overline{X})
= n_{XY} / n_X - n_{\overline{X}Y} / n_{\overline{X}}
$$

**Range:** $[-1, 1]$ (0 means statistical independence)

## Example and Counter-Example Rate {#counterexample}

Example rate reduced by the counter-example rate.

Defined as
$$\mathrm{ecr}(X \Rightarrow Y) = 
\frac{n_{XY} - n_{X\overline{Y}}}{n_{XY}} =
\frac{P(X \cap Y) - P(X \cap \overline{Y})}{P(X \cap Y)} =
1 - \frac{1}{sebag(X \Rightarrow Y)}
$$

The measure is related to the [Sebag-Schoenauer Measure](#sebag-schoenauer).

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

## Fisher's Exact Test {#fishersexacttest}
**Reference:** @arules:Hahsler:2007

If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then the $n_{XY}$
is a realization of the random variable $C_{XY}$ which has a hypergeometric distribution with $n_Y$ draws from a population with $n_X$ successes and $n_{\overline{X}}$ failures.
The p-value for [Fisher's one-sided exact test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test) giving the probability
of observing a contingency table with a count of at least $n_{XY}$
given the observed marginal counts is

$$
\textrm{p-value} = P(C_{XY} \ge n_{XY}) 
$$

The p-value is related to [hyper-confidence](#hyper-confidence).
Compared to the [Chi-squared test](#chi-squared), Fisher's exact test
also applies when cells have low expected counts.
Note that each rule represents a statistical test, and 
[correction for multiple comparisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem) 
may be necessary.

**Range:** $[0, 1]$ (p-value scale)

## Gini Index {#gini}
**Reference:** @arules:Tan:2004

The [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) measures quadratic entropy as

$$\mathrm{gini}(X \Rightarrow Y) =
P(X)    [P(Y|X)^2+P(\overline{Y}|X)^2] +
P(\overline{X}) [P(B|\overline{X})^2+P(\overline{Y}|\overline{X})^2] -
P(Y)^2 - P(\overline{Y})^2
$$

**Range:** $[0, 1]$ (0 means that the rule does not provide any information for the dataset)

## Hyper-Confidence {#hyperconfidence}
**Reference:** @arules:Hahsler:2007

The confidence level for observation of too high/low counts
for rules $X \Rightarrow Y$ using the hypergeometric model.
Since the counts are drawn from a hypergeometric distribution
(represented by the random variable $C_{XY}$ with
known parameters given by the counts  $n_X$ and  $n_Y$,
we can calculate a confidence interval for the observed counts
$n_{XY}$ stemming from the distribution. Hyper-confidence
reports the confidence level as

$$ 
\textrm{hyper-conf}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= 1 - P[C_{XY} \ge n_{XY} | n_X, n_Y]
$$

A confidence level of, e.g., $> 0.95$ indicates that
there is only a  5% chance that the high count for the rule has occurred 
randomly. Hyper-confidence is equivalent to 
the statistic used to calculate the p-value in 
[Fisher's exact test](#fishers-exact-test). 
Note that each rule represents a statistical test and 
[correction for multiple comparisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem) 
may be necessary.

Hyper-Confidence can also be used to evaluate that $X$ and $Y$ are
complementary (i.e., the count is too low to have occurred randomly). 

$$ 
\textrm{hyper-conf}_\textrm{complement}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= 1 - P[C_{XY} < n_{XY} | n_X, n_Y]
$$

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

## Hyper-Lift {#hyperlift}
**Reference:** @arules:Hahsler:2007

Adaptation of the lift measure 
where instead of dividing by the expected count under independence 
($E[C_{XY}] = n_X / n \times n_Y / n$) a higher quantile of the 
hypergeometric count distribution is used. 
This is more robust for low counts and results in fewer 
false positives when hyper-lift is used for rule filtering.
Hyper-lift is defined as:

$$
\textrm{hyper-lift}_\delta(X \Rightarrow Y) = 
\frac{n_{XY}}{Q_{\delta}[C_{XY}]}
$$

where  $n_{XY}$ is the number of transactions containing 
$X$ and $Y$ and
$Q_{\delta}[C_{XY}]$ is the $\delta$-quantile of the 
hypergeometric distribution 
with parameters $n_X$ and $n_Y$.  
$\delta$ is typically chosen to use the 99 or 95% quantile.

**Range:** $[0, \infty]$ (1 indicates independence)

## Imbalance Ratio {#imbalance}
**Alias:** IR

**Reference:** @arules:Wu:2010

Measures the degree of imbalance between two events
that the LHS and the RHS are contained in a transaction.
The ratio is close to 0 if the conditional probabilities are similar (i.e.,
very balanced) and
close to 1 if they are very different.
It is defined as

$$
\mathrm{IB}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= \frac{|P(X|Y) - P(Y|X)|}{P(X|Y) + P(Y|X) - P(X|Y)P(Y|X))}
= \frac{|supp(X) - supp(Y)|}{supp(X) + supp(Y) - supp(X \cup Y)}
$$

**Range:** $[0, 1]$ (0 indicates a balanced, typically uninteresting rule)

## Implication Index {#implicationindex}
**Reference:** @arules:Gras:1996

A variation of the [Lerman similarity](#lerman-similarity) defined as 

$$
\mathrm{gras}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= \sqrt{N} \frac{supp(X \cup \overline{Y}) - supp(X)supp(\overline{Y})}{\sqrt{supp(X)supp(\overline{Y})}}
$$

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

## Importance {#importance}
**Reference:** <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/analysis-services/data-mining/microsoft-association-algorithm-technical-reference">MS Analysis Services: Microsoft Association Algorithm Technical Reference.</a> 

In the Microsoft Association Algorithm Technical Reference, confidence is called "probability," and
a measure called importance is defined as
the log-likelihood of the right-hand side of the rule, 
given the left-hand side of the rule:

$$
\mathrm{importance}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= log_{10}(L(X \Rightarrow Y) / L(X \Rightarrow \overline{Y}))
$$

where $L$ is the [Laplace corrected confidence](#laplace-corrected-confidence).

**Range:** $[-\infty, \infty]$

## Improvement {#improvement}
**Reference:** @arules:Bayardo:2000

The  improvement of a rule is
the minimum difference between its confidence and the confidence of any
proper sub-rule with the same consequent.
The idea is that we only want to extend the LHS of the rule
if this improves the rule sufficiently.

$$
\mathrm{improvement}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= min_{X' \subset X}(conf(X \Rightarrow Y) - conf(X' \Rightarrow Y))
$$  

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

## Jaccard Coefficient {#jaccard}
**Reference:** @arules:Tan:2004

A null-invariant measure 
for dependence using the [Jaccard similarity index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) 
between the two sets 
of transactions that contain the items in $X$ and $Y$, 
respectively. Defined as 

$$
\mathrm{jaccard}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= \frac{supp(X \cup Y)}{supp(X) + supp(Y) - supp(X \cup Y)}
= \frac{P(X \cap Y)}{P(X)+P(Y)-P(X \cap Y)}
$$

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

## J-Measure {#jmeasure}
<a href= @arules:Smyth:1991

The J-measure is a scaled version of cross entropy to measure the information content of a rule.

$$

## Leverage {#leverage}
**Alias:** Piatetsky-Shapiro, PS

**Reference:** @arules:Piatetsky-Shapiro:1991
$$
\mathrm{PS}(X \Rightarrow Y) = leverage(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= supp(X \Rightarrow Y) - supp(X)supp(Y) 
= P(X \cap Y) - P(X)P(Y)
$$

Leverage measures the difference of $X$ and $Y$
appearing together in the data set and what would be expected
if $X$ and $Y$ were statistically dependent. The
rationale in a sales setting is to find out how many more
units (items $X$ and $Y$ together) are sold than
expected from the independent sells.

Using minimum leverage thresholds incorporates at the same time
an implicit frequency constraint. E.g., for setting a min.
leverage thresholds to 0.01% (corresponds to 10 occurrences in
a data set with 100,000 transactions) one first can use an
algorithm to find all itemsets with min. support of 0.01% and
then filter the found item sets using the leverage
constraint. Because of this property, leverage also can suffer
from the rare item problem.

Leverage is a unnormalized version of the [phi correlation coefficient](#phi-correlation-coefficient).

**Range:** $[-1, 1]$ (0 indicates independence)

## Lift {#lift}
**Alias:** Interest, interest factor

**Reference:** @arules:Brin:1997

Lift was originally called interest by Brin et al. Later, lift, the name of an equivalent measure popular in advertising and predictive modeling became more common. Lift is defined as

$$
\textrm{lift}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= \textrm{lift}(Y \Rightarrow X) 
= \frac{conf(X \Rightarrow Y)}{supp(Y)} 
= \frac{P(Y | X)}{P(Y)} 
= \frac{P(X \cap Y)}{P(X)P(Y)}
= n \frac{n_{XY}}{n_X n_Y}
$$

Lift measures how many times more often $X$ and $Y$
occur together than expected if they were statistically
independent. A lift value of 1 indicates independence between
$X$ and $Y$. 
For statistical tests, see the 
[Chi-squared test statistic](#chi-squared),
[Fisher's exact test](#fishers-exact-test), and
[hyper-confidence](#hyper-confidence).

Lift is not downward closed and does not suffer from the
rare item problem. However, lift is susceptible to noise in small
databases. Rare itemsets with low counts (low probability),
which by chance occur a few times (or only once) together,
can produce enormous lift values.

**Range:** $[0, \infty]$ (1 means independence)

## Odds Ratio {#oddsratio}
**Reference:** @arules:Tan:2004

For the analysis of
$2 \times 2$ contingency tables,
the [odds ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio) is a measure of the relationship between two binary 
variables. 
It is defined as the ratio of the odds of a transaction 
containing Y in the groups of transactions that do and do 
not contain $X$.

$$
\mathrm{OR}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= \frac{\frac{P(Y | X)}{1 - P(Y | X)}}{\frac{P(Y | \overline{X})}{1 - P(Y | \overline{X})}} 
= \frac{\frac{conf(X \Rightarrow Y)}{1 - conf(X \Rightarrow Y)}}{\frac{conf(\overline{X} \Rightarrow Y)}{1 - conf(\overline{X} \Rightarrow Y)}} 
= \frac{n_{XY} n_{\overline{X}\overline{Y}}}
{n_{X\overline{Y}} n_{\overline{X}Y}}
$$

A confidence interval around the odds ratio can be calculated [@arules:Li:2014] using a normal approximation. 
$$
\omega = z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{XY}} + \frac{1}{n_{X\overline{Y}}} + \frac{1}{n_{\overline{X}Y}} + \frac{1}{n_{\overline{X}\overline{Y}}}}
$$

$$
\mathrm{CI}(X \Rightarrow Y) = [OR(X \Rightarrow Y) \exp(-\omega), OR(X \Rightarrow Y) \exp(\omega)] 
$$

where $\alpha/2$ is the critical value for a confidence level of $1-\alpha$.

**Range:** $[0, \infty]$ (1 indicates that Y is not associated with X)

## Phi Correlation Coefficient {#phi}
**Reference:** @arules:Tan:2004

The [Phi correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_coefficient) between the transactions containing X and Y represented as two binary vectors.
Phi correlation is equivalent to Pearson's Product Moment Correlation 
Coefficient $\rho$ with 0-1 values and related to the [chi-squared test statistics](#chi-squared) for $2 \times 2$ contingency tables.

$$
\phi(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= \frac{n n_{XY} - n_Xn_Y}{\sqrt{n_X n_Y n_{\overline{X}} n_{\overline{Y}}}}
= \frac{P(X \cap Y) - P(X)P(Y)}{\sqrt{P(X) (1 - P(X)) P(Y) (1 - P(Y))}}
$$

In machine learning, Phi correlation is also known as the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The magnitude of the correlation is also related to the chi-squared statistic:

$$
|\phi(X \Rightarrow Y)| = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n}}
$$

**Range:** $[-1, 1]$ (0 when X and Y are independent)}

independence given the supports of X and Y.

$$D = \frac{n_{XY} n_{\overline{X}\overline{Y}} - n_{X\overline{Y}} n_{\overline{X}Y}}{n}$$

$$\mathrm{RLD} = \begin{cases} 
 D / (D + min(n_{X\overline{Y}}, n_{\overline{X}Y})) \quad\textrm{if}\quad D>0 \\

## Relative Risk {#relativerisk}
**Reference:** @arules:Sistrom:2004

For the analysis of
$2 \times 2$ contingency tables,
relative risk is a measure of the relationship between two binary 
variables. It is defined as the ratio of the proportion of transactions 
containing $Y$ in the two groups of transactions the do and 
do not contain $X$. In epidemiology, this corresponds to the 
ratio of the risk of having disease $Y$ in the exposed ($X$)
and unexposed ($\overline{X}$) groups.

$$
\mathrm{RR}(X \Rightarrow Y)
= \frac{n_{XY} / n_X}{n_{\overline{X}Y} / n_{\overline{X}}} 
= \frac{P(Y | X)}{P(Y | \overline{X})}

## Standardized Lift {#stdlift}
**Reference:** @arules:McNicholas:2008

Standardized lift uses the minimum and maximum lift that can reach for each rule to standardize lift between 0 and 1. The possible range of lift is
given by the minimum

$$
\lambda = \frac{\mathrm{max}\{P(X) + P(Y) - 1, 1/n\}}{P(X)P(Y)}.
$$

and the maximum

$$
\upsilon = \frac{1}{\mathrm{max}\{P(X), P(Y)\}}
$$

The standardized lift is defined as

$$
\mathrm{stdLift}(X \Rightarrow Y) 
= \frac{\mathrm{lift}(X \Rightarrow Y) - \lambda}{ \upsilon - \lambda}.
$$

The standardized lift measure can be corrected for minimum support and minimum confidence used in rule mining by replacing the minimum bound $\lambda$ with

$$
\lambda^* 
= \mathrm{max}\left\{\lambda, \frac{4s}{(1+s)^2}, \frac{s}{P(X)P(Y)}, \frac{c}{P(Y)}\right\}.
$$

**Range:** $[0, 1]$

where $\alpha = OR(X \Rightarrow Y)$ is the [odds ratio](#odds-ratio) of the rule.

**Range:** $[-1, 1]$
