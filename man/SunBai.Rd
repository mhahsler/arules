\description{
A small example database for weighted association rule mining provided as an
object of class \link{transactions}.
}
\details{
The data set contains the example database described in the paper by K. Sun
and F.Bai for illustration of the concepts of weighted association rule
mining. \code{weight} stored as transaction information denotes the
transaction weights obtained using the HITS algorithm.
