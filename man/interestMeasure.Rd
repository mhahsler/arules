\title{Calculate Additional Interest Measures}
\description{
Provides the generic function \code{interestMeasure} and the needed S4 method 
to calculate various additional interest measures for existing sets of
itemsets or rules. A searchable list of definitions, equations and references for all available interest measures can be found here: 
\href{http://michael.hahsler.net/research/association_rules/measures.html}{A Probabilistic Comparison of Commonly Used Interest Measures for Association Rules} (Hahsler, 2015).
}
\usage{
interestMeasure(x, measure, transactions = NULL, reuse = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ a set of itemsets or rules. }
  \item{measure}{ name or vector of names of the desired interest measures 
      (see details for available measures). If measure is missing then all 
      available measures are calculated.} 
  \item{transactions}{ the transaction data set used to mine 
    the associations or a set of different transactions to calculate
    interest measures from (Note: you need to set \code{reuse=FALSE} in the 
    later case). }
  \item{reuse}{ logical indicating if information in quality slot should
      be reuse for calculating the measures. This speeds up the process
      significantly since only very little (or no) transaction counting 
      is necessary if support, confidence and lift are already available.
      Use \code{reuse=FALSE} to force counting (might be very slow but
      is necessary if you use a different set of transactions than was used 
      for mining).}
  \item{\dots}{ further arguments for the measure calculation. }

  Defined on itemsets as the ratio of the support of the least frequent item 
  to the support of the most frequent item.

  a ratio smaller than a set threshold. Normally many found patterns are 
  cross-support patterns which contain frequent as well as rare items. Such 
  patterns often tend to be spurious.

  Range: \eqn{[0, 1]}}

  probability (support) of the itemset over the product of the probabilities 
  of all items in the itemset, i.e., 
  \eqn{\frac{supp(X)}{\prod_{x \in X} supp(X)}}{supp(X)/(supp(x_1) supp(x_2) ... supp(x_n))}. 
  
  Range: \eqn{[0, \infty]}{[0, Inf]} (1 indicated independence)}

\item{"support", supp (Agrawal et al., 1996)}{
  
  Support is an estimate of \eqn{P(X)}, a measure of generality of the itemset. It is estimated by

  The critical value of the chi-squared distribution with \eqn{1} degree of 
  freedom (2x2 contingency table) at \eqn{\alpha=0.05}{alpha=0.05} 
  is \eqn{3.84}; higher chi-squared
  values indicate that the lhs and the rhs are not independent.  
  See details: \href{https://michael.hahsler.net/research/association_rules/measures.html#chisquared}{Chi-Squared statistic}
  
  %Note that if
  %any cell in the contingency table has an expected value below \eqn{5}, the
  %chi-square value is set to \code{NA} 
  %since the approximation used in the chi-square test breaks down.
  Note that the contingency table is likely to have cells with
  low expected values and that thus
  Fisher's Exact Test might be more appropriate 
  (see below).
  
  Called with \code{significance=TRUE}, the p-value of the test for 
  independence is returned instead of the chi-squared statistic.
