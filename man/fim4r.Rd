\usage{
fim4r(
  transactions,
  method = NULL,
  target = "frequent",
  support = 0.1,
  confidence = 0.8,
  originalSupport = TRUE,
  appear = NULL,
  report = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{transactions}{a \link{transactions} object}

\item{method}{the algorithm to be used. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"apriori"}, \code{"eclat"}, \code{"fpgrowth"} can mine itemsets and rules.
\item \code{"relim"}, \code{"sam"} can mine itemsets.
\item \code{"carpenter"}, \code{"ista"}  can only mine closed itemset.
}}

\item{target}{the target type. One of: \code{"frequent"},
\code{"closed"}, \code{"maximal"}, \code{"generators"} or \code{"rules"}.}

\item{support}{a numeric value for the minimal support in the range \eqn{[0,1]}.}

\item{confidence}{a numeric value for the minimal confidence of rules in the range \eqn{[0,1]}.}

\item{originalSupport}{logical; Use the support threshold on the support of the whole rule (LHS and RHS).
If \code{FALSE}, then LHS support (i.e., coverage) is used by the support threshold.}

\item{appear}{Specify item appearance in rules (only for apriori, eclat, fpgrowth
and the target \code{"rules"}) Specify a list with two vectors (item labels and
appearance modifiers) of the same length. Appearance modifiers are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"-"} (item may not appear in a rule),
\item \code{"a"} (item may only appear a rule antecedent/LHS),
\item \code{"c"} (item may only appear a rule consequent/RHS),
\item \code{"x"} (item may appear anywhere).
}}

\item{report}{cannot be used via the interface.}

\item{verbose}{logical; print used parameters?}

\item{...}{further arguments are passed on to the function
the \code{fim4r::fim4r} function for the given method. Examples
are: \code{zmin}, \code{zmax}, \code{wgts}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \link{itemsets} or \link{rules}.
}
\description{
Interfaces the algorithms implemented in fim4r. The algorithms include:
Apriori, Eclat, FPgrowth, Carpenter, IsTa, RElim and SaM.
}
\details{
\strong{Installation:}
The package \pkg{fim4r} is not available via CRAN. If needed,
the \code{fim4r()} function downloads and installs the current version of the
package automatically. Your system needs to have build tools installed.

Build tools: You need to be able to install source packages. For Windows
users this means that you need to install the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}{RTools} with a version
matching your R version.

\strong{Additional Notes:}
\itemize{
\item Support and confidence are specified here in the range \eqn{[0,1]}.
This is different from the use in  \code{fim4r} package where \code{supp} and \code{conf}
have the range \eqn{[0, 100]}.
\code{arules::fim4r()} automatically converts support and confidence internally.
\item \code{fim4r} methods also return the empty itemset while \code{arules} methods do not.
\item See \code{? fim4r::fim4r} for help on additional available arguments. This is only available
after package \code{fim4r} is installed.
\item Algorithm descriptions and references can be found on the
\href{https://borgelt.net/fim4r.html}{fim4r web page} in the References Section.
