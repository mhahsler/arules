\title{Find Closed Itemsets}
\description{
Provides the generic function and the S4 method \code{is.closed} for finding
closed itemsets. Closed itemsets are used as a concise representation of frequent itemsets.
The closure of an itemset is its largest proper superset
which has the same support (is contained in exactly the same transactions). An
itemset is closed, if it is its own closure (Pasquier et al. 1999).

Closed frequent itemsets can also be mined directly using \code{link{apriori}} or \code{link{eclat}} with target "closed frequent itemsets".

\usage{
is.closed(x)

\arguments{
  \item{x}{ a set of itemsets. }
}
\value{a logical vector with the same length as \code{x} indicating
for each element in \code{x} if it is a closed itemset.
